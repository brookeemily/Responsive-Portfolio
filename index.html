        <p id="bio"> Hi! My name's Brooke!
            <br>
            <br> I graduated from Penn State University with my Bachelor of Design in the spring of 2018. I was a part of the
            Interdisciplinary Digital Studio program at Penn State. While in the program I was able to learn all about digital
            design - I worked on projects of all kinds from 2D design, 3D design, interactive design, photography, photo
            editing, videography, video editing, physical computing, and game design.
            <br>
            <br> After briefly searching for design jobs, I've decided to pursue web development to build off of my current skillset
            as a digital designer and open up more fulfilling career opportunities. I've always loved exploring new ways
            to create things and I'm so excited to be jumping into web development!
            <br>
            <br> I currently work at Chipotle to make some $$$ on the side. When I'm not rolling burritos or coding you can usually
            find me playing guitar, sitting by the pool, binge watching TV, or playing video games.  </p>
